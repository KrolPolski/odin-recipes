        <h1>Peach Cobbler</h1>
        <img src="cobbler.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is based on a cobbler I used to make in bulk at a southern barbecue restaurant. It is very sweet, and thus is well suited to American tastes. It pairs very well with vanilla ice cream, but it is also great on its own, hot or cold.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>2 29 oz cans of sliced peaches in heavy syrup</li>
           <li>2 1/3 cup whole milk</li>
           <li>2 1/3 cup self rising flour</li>
           <li>2 1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
           <li>1 1/3 sticks of butter</li>
           <li>1 capful vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 F</li>
            <li>Cut the butter into pieces about 1 tbsp each and arrange them relatively evenly in the bottom of a 9x13" pan.</li>
            <li>Open and drain peaches, and then arrange them in a flat layer in the pan.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk, self rising flour, sugar and vanilla with a whisk until there are no lumps.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture over peaches as evenly as possible.</li>
            <li>Bake in a 350 F oven until a knife comes out clean. This will take at least an hour, but if you are cooking with a glass casserole dish it may take considerably longer than with a metal pan.</li>
            <li>Let rest 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
