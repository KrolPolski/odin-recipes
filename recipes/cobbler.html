        <img src="cobbler.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is based on a cobbler I used to make in bulk at a southern barbecue restaurant. It is very sweet, and thus is well suited to American tastes. It pairs very well with vanilla ice cream, but it is also great on its own, hot or cold.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

           <li>2 29 oz cans of sliced peaches in heavy syrup</li>

           <li>2 1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
           <li>1 1/3 sticks of butter</li>
           <li>1 capful vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
