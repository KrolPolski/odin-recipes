        <img src="potroast.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is my favorite use of a crock pot. The prep time is minimal and the results are very satisfying.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>1 beef pot roast</li>
           <li>Beef boullion cubes</li>
           <li>potatoes</li>
           <li>carrots</li>
           <li>onions</li>          
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put pot roast in crock pot.</li>
            <li>In a separate mixing bowl, add boiling water and boullion cubes to make beef broth. You need enough to fully cover the pot roast, plus a little extra.</li>
            <li>Pour the broth over the pot roast.</li>
            <li>Set your crock pot to medium (or low if you have only two settings).</li>
            <li>Let it cook overnight.</li>
            <li>About three hours before you intend to serve it, cut the potatoes into wedges, and slice the carrots into half inch pieces, and add to crock pot.</li>
            <li>Quarter two onions, and then separate the pieces into the crock pot.</li>
            <li>Check the potatoes for doneness about 2 hours later. When the veggies are done, everything is done. Enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
